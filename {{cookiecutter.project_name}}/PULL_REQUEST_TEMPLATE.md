## Version Changes
Top level visibility into the change of model versions.

For example:

Old Version: 1.0.0
New Version: 1.1.0

## Why

This is a place for higher-level explanations, and should keep
implementation/engineering details to the minimum. What was the
motivation for this code change? Is this part of a larger job? Does it
have a ticket? Is it a hotfix? etc.

## Changes

Enumerate message and model changes as well as api expectations and
behavioral changes.

## Test Plan

You've written tests of course, but there may be some other things you
did or looked at in the process of evaluating the code, don't be shy,
list 'em.
